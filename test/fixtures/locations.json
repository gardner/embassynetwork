We will be keeping the name, as well as the tradition of community and intention that the property has held for the past 40 years. <strong>We are still under renovation on the 2nd floor but the 3rd floor is ready to host you! Note that the Red Victorian is not offering breakfast at this time, while we complete renovations.</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"lead center\">The 20 rooms are receiving a facelift, with new mattresses and linens and paint. The configuration is a little different than before, with the introduction of some shared rooms, and the offering of longer term stays. The prices are on par with what they were before. We have done our best to have options that are both affordable and indulgent. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"center\">Our Culture</h2>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"lead center\">\r\nThis is not your typical hotel! This is an immersive, experimental, mixed-use space with a diverse cross section of people from around the world coming here to work on projects, see the city, find collaborators, and create the world they seek.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"lead center\">We ask you to <strong>fill out a profile</strong> so we can share that information about what you're up to with other guests and residents, facilitating interactions and collaborations. While here, we invite you to <a href=\"events/upcoming\">attend</a> and <a href=\"events/create\">host</a> your own events, from talks to skillshares to art shows or joint dinners. This is a participatory space, and we hope it will be a platform for your creative projects and ideas. What do you want to create?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"lead\">The ground floor is being redesigned as a member-supported <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place\">3rd space</a> for projects, collaboration, events and activities, expected to open late 2014/early 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"lead center\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"lead center\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"lead center\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"lead center\"></p>\r\n", "slug": "redvic", "ssid": "redvic1", "ssid_password": "modernomad", "stay_page": "<p class=\"lead\">\r\nWe opened our 3rd floor to guests on <strong>September 1</strong> and hope you will enjoy your stay with us! We also wish to ensure you know we will still be finalizing some aspects of the hotel during these early months, and looking to our guests and community to <strong>make suggestions</strong>. The ground floor is still having some work done. We are not currently serving breakfast, but we have plenty of snacks on site to eat here or take on the go!  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"lead\">The hotel has 20 rooms, which offer short-term stays as well as a membership options. Like other <a href=\"http://embassynetwork.com/locations\">Embassy Network locations</a> we seek to host creatives and modern nomads traveling frequently for work and collaborations. <strong>Our large community space on the ground floor provides ample space for projects and collaborations, or go relax in the more private lounge on the third floor.</strong> Host or attend events, work on a project, or invite a friend over to hang, meet people, or make something!</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"lead\">We've kept the names of the rooms as they were. All rooms have their own sinks, and several have en-suite bathrooms. While we complete painting and renovations, the pictures below are representative based on the rooms which are complete, but in most cases what you see is a different but similar room to the exact one you will be sleeping in.
